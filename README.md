## Learning Planner

Platform for users to design their own free learning plans. Information is readily available on the internet for use. However, major platforms and websites push/encourage users to pay for paywalled courses that can be sub-par or not very helpful. "Tutorial Hell"

The basis of this platform is a tool for users to collate information from free sources across the web and curate their own learning plan. Inspiration has been taken from the design of university courses including assigned readings, weekly deliverables/projects and a structured, periodized learning methodology. Users can share their own curated learning plan that actually helped them learn a particular skill or subject which can help others who are just starting out. There is potential for Artificial Intelligence integration to augment the creation of a learning plan

  [reference](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/12-8-4-column-system-for-responsive-grids-df207a58ebc)
- consistent gutter and column width sizes throughout layout for consistent design
- Wireframing Process:
  1. What are the main screens and what type of content do you want to include in each?
  2. Brainstorm - wireframe/sketch ideas for a screen on paper.
  3. Identify components/ideas that pop out/might work well and why.
  4. Re-arrange and make a composite if necessary. Repeat for all different screens
